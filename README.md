# How to Use It
1. To use this script, you will first need to obtain an API secret key from the OpenAI website. Once you have your secret key, follow these steps:

2. Insert your API secret key into the `secrets.txt` file. You can find your secret key by going to your OpenAI account page and navigating to the "API Keys" section.

3. Run the `encrypt_secrets.py` script to encrypt your secret key.

4. Now that your secret key is encrypted, you can use the `main.py` script to interact with the OpenAI API.
